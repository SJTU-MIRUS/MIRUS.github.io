This paper addresses the problem of high-speed waypoint tracking and real-time obstacle avoidance for large-scale underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) in the vertical plane. Specifically, a robust nonlinear model predictive control (RNMPC) scheme is proposed, considering different types of constraints including the scale of the AUV, the finite field of view of the sensor, the input saturation, the physical limits on system state, and the influence of the vertical underactuated velocity. To navigate in the completely unknown environment with nonconvex obstacles, a dynamic sensing and collision avoidance scheme is proposed so that the collision avoidance can be properly formulated into convex constraints in the RNMPC optimization problem. Recursive feasibility and closed-loop stability are proved rigorously. Through the high-fidelity simulations with graph and data visualization techniques, the proposed algorithm has higher waypoint tracking accuracy, safer obstacle avoidance ability, and better multiple constraints handling capability than the existing dynamic virtual AUV (DVA) technique.
